# our-solar-system

Our Solar System is a back-end application that provides information about the planets and their respective moons in our solar system. This simple and educational app serves as the foundation for building a full-stack application with a front-end interface to display celestial data to users


### Features

* Data about planets and their moons
* Separate JSON files for planets and moons
* Node.js-based back-end for serving data

### Getting Started
To get started with the "Our Solar System" back-end app, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed on your system.

#### Installation:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/our-solar-system-backend.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies: 
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the back-end server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```
The server will be running at http://localhost:5500.

### Usage

The app provides API endpoints to access information about planets and their moons. You can make HTTP requests to these endpoints to retrieve data in JSON format.

### API Endpoints
* `planets.json`: Contains information about each planet in our solar system.
* `moons.json`: Contains information about the moons orbiting each planet.

Feel free to expand the data or modify it to include additional information as needed.
